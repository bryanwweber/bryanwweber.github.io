I'm Bryan Weber.

I work on open source software projects which are described on the [code page]({filename}/pages/code.md). I share some of the things I've learned on my [blog](/writing.html).

In a previous life, I was an academic and my most recent publications and classes are on the [work page]({filename}/pages/cv.md). Please feel free to email any questions or inquiries to <bryan@bryanwwweber.com>.
