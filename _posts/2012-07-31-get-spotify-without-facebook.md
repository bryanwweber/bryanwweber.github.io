Spotify, the <del>(supposedly, I just got an account)</del> **(Update: It is excellent, and I highly recommend paying for premium)** excellent music streaming service, offers free streaming stations to your mobile device and computer, similar to Pandora. Since they just updated their Android app, I decided I wanted an account, but found that the only way to get one was to connect to Facebook. Since I didn't want to do that, a bit of googling found this <a href="http://http://www.spotidj.com/blog/how-to-get-spotify-without-facebook/">link</a>, which details how to sign up for a German account without connecting to Facebook, then changing your country once you have an account. These instructions worked great, except I had to go to the "Subscriptions" tab of my account to actually change my country, by giving them a credit card or PayPal. Since I intend to get the premium service if I like it, I didn't mind this, but you can delete the payment information if you so wish after you change your country.
