Title: Bryan W. Weber

# Welcome

I'm Bryan Weber. My current vocation is as the director of undergraduate studies and an assistant professor in residence in the
[Mechanical Engineering](https://me.engr.uconn.edu) department at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu).
In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, playing Ultimate and cycling.

My primary focus at the University is teaching thermo-fluids courses. Aside from teaching, my
research focus is on software tools for combustion research and thermodynamics, which you can find
on my [Code page]({filename}/pages/code.md). I also do research with the [Combustion Diagnostics
Laboratory](http://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu), headed by [Prof. Jackie Sung][1]. Please see my
[research page]({filename}/pages/work.md) for more information.

In addition to research and hobbies, I enjoy writing about recent articles that catch my eye from the literature.
I'm aiming to distill the articles and present them such that any lay person with an interest in science will grasp
the highlights and implications on the broader world. These can be found in the
[Research Revealed!]({category}Research Revealed!) section.

Occasionally I'll post other writing (mostly notes to myself about various programming projects) in the
[programming section]({category}personal).
