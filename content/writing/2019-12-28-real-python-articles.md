For about a year, I've been writing for a website called [_Real Python_](https://realpython.com). They publish tutorials and video courses on using Python effectively. So far, I've published two articles with them:

* [Defining Main Functions in Python](https://realpython.com/python-main-function)
* [MATLAB vs Python: Why and How to Make the Switch](https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python)

I've also help edit a few articles, and one of those has been published as well:

* [NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas: Correlation With Python](https://realpython.com/numpy-scipy-pandas-correlation-python/)

Take a look and leave a comment on _Real Python_. Look out for more content coming soon!
