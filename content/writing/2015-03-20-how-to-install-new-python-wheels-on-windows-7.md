Christoph Gohlke's website for Python packages for Windows (he hosts many, but
the most popular are probably numpy and scipy) now distributes wheels instead of
exe files. This means we need the most recent version of pip and a new procedure
to install them. Here's a procedure I use to simplify installing dependencies.
<!--more-->

First, create a new folder to store all of the files in; I put mine in
`C:\Users\user\Documents\python-upgrades`. Then, go to Christoph's site and
download all of the packages you need and put them in the folder you just
created. Now, open any text editor and create a file called `requirements.txt`.
The contents of that file should be a list of all the packages you downloaded;
for instance, mine looks like:

```python
Cython
scipy
numpy
tornado
matplotlib
requests
pyparsing
lxml
Pillow
```

Then, pop open a command window and change to the directory you created.
Finally, run the command

```batch
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --no-index -f . --no-deps
```

This should look up all the wheel files in the current directory while ignoring
PyPI.
