Professional Experience
---
Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, 2014--Present  
Conducting research on the combustion kinetics of alternative and traditional
fuels. Teaching undergraduate courses in thermal-fluids engineering.
Mentoring undergraduate students in the capstone design project.

Graduate Research Assistant, University of Connecticut, 2009--2014  
Undergraduate Research Assistant, Case Western Reserve University, 2007--2009  
[Combustion Diagnostics Laboratory](http://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu)  
Director: Chih-Jen (Jackie) Sung

Conducted experimental and computational studies of the ignition
properties of several alternative fuels and foundational fuels, with
a focus on engine-relevant conditions.
Designed a species sampling apparatus for time-resolved
species measurements in the rapid compression machine, using gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify and quantify
combustion intermediates.
Analyzed kinetic models of combustion to determine the parameters
controlling prediction of ignition delay and to improve the ability of
the models to predict combustion events.

In general, my research interests lie in the area of combustion engineering and energy sustainability.
