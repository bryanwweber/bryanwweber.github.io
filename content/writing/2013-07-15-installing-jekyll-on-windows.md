Been trying to migrate this site to use Jekyll
([http://jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)) today and finally got it working
with Pygments for code highlighting.

Following the tutorial here: [Running Jekyll on
Windows](http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2011/09/01/runningjekyllwindows.html)

~~I installed Ruby and the dev kit as suggested.~~

**Update:** How to install Ruby on Windows: Because Windows makes it a pain to
manage dependencies, it is more difficult to install development software on
Windows. However, the nice folks at [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org)
have created the installers for Windows for us. I downloaded the
[Ruby-2.0.0-p353
(x64)](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-2.0.0-p353-x64.exe?direct)
(EXE) installer and the [Dev Kit
mingw64](http://cdn.rubyinstaller.org/archives/devkits/DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe)
(EXE) installer. Make sure to check the box to add the Ruby executable to your
PATH in the installer.

My installation directories were the default for Ruby and `C:\dev kit` for the
dev kit. Then, the simple commands

```batch
cd "C:\dev kit"
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
gem install jekyll
```

built the dependencies and installed Jekyll. To get the code syntax highlighting
working, we need [Python](https://www.python.org) and pip (the Python package
manager). The directions in the previously listed tutorial provide a work-around
to be able to use Python 3 *but this work-around no longer works!* Jekyll has
switched to using the `pygments.rb` gem instead of the `albino.rb` gem.
`pygments.rb` is only compatible with Python 2.x. Therefore, you must install
[Python 2.x](https://www.python.org/download/) (I used 2.7.5). After Python is
installed (the default directory `C:\Python27` is good), download setup_tools
and pip from here:

* [`setuptools`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools")
* [`pip`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip)

Make sure you download the version for the right Python! Then, the installers
should automatically find the correct Python install. Credit for the simple
solution goes to Colonel Panic at StackOverflow: [How to install pip on
Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/2449192). Also, we don't need to
worry about a C++ compiler for the package we'll be installing, but if you
intend to make more general usage of pip, you may need a C++ compiler.

Once `setuptools` and `pip` are installed, you need to add the directory where
you installed `pip` to the `PATH` variable. To do this, right click on My
Computer (either on the desktop or in the start menu), click Properties, then in
the left column click Advanced System Settings, then at the bottom of the next
window click Environment Variables. In this window, there are two variables we
need to change. The first is in the User section, called `PATH` or `Path`. Click
this variable, then edit, and add the directory to your `pip` install at the
front of the text box. If you accepted all the defaults, this directory will be
`C:\Python27\Scripts;` add it to the `PATH` and make sure the semicolon is in
there to separate this entry from the next. Then, we need to add the Python
directory itself to the System PATH, so go to the System box below the User box
and same procedure, except the path to be added is `C:\Python27;`. If you
already have Python 3 installed, make sure that the Python 2 entry appears to
the left of the Python 3 entry; otherwise, Jekyll will try to use Python 3 by
default because it searches the directories from left to right to find the file
it is looking for.

Now, restart the Windows command line, and type `pip install Pygments`

Finally, Jekyll is installed with support for code highlighting. To test, in
your command line type

```batch
cd "C:\Users\_User_\Documents" & ::Where _User_ is your user name
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
jekyll serve -w
```

You can now open a browser window to `localhost:4000` and your (default) Jekyll
webpage should open! Feel free to make changes to the markdown and css, and
Jekyll should automagically update the site if you refresh your browser.

Update: If the command `jekyll serve -w` isn't working with the error `Liquid
Exception: No such file or directory...` you may need to downgrade the
`pygments.rb` gem. First, edit your `_config.yml` file for the site and set the
Pygments option to false, then try to start the server again. If everything
works, you need to downgrade. Following the SO question
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17364028/jekyll-on-windows-pygments-not-working),
type

```batch
gem uninstall pygments.rb --version "=0.5.1"
gem install pygments.rb --version "=0.5.0"
```

and reset the Pygments option in `_config.yml` to true to get it working.
