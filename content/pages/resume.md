## Select Experiences

Staff Software Engineer, [Rebellion Defense](https://rebelliondefense.com), 2024--Present  
Senior Software Engineer, 2022--2024

- Lead Python developer on a modular and scalable microservice-based system to process tens-to-hundreds of thousands of sensor messages for battlefield observability. Built with Python, golang, gRPC, and RabbitMQ.
- Led 1-month integration of ML algorithms for a \$1M/year contract. Enabled evaluating thousands of potential actions per second, while current capabilities are limited to dozens per day.
- Led as the subject matter expert for ML-based task assignment algorithms during \$1M/year-contract close-out demonstration to the Chief Scientist of the Air Force.
- Integrated LLM-generated action report summaries in our adversary emulation software. Used the OpenAI API with an optimized prompt to produce high-level overviews for non-technical stakeholders.
- Developed pipelines that rapidly deployed ML models to perform cyber-asset criticality assessment and automated training data generation. Used Flyte, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS to maintain model provenance.
- Championed developer productivity by seeking out and implementing more efficient tools while strategically removing unused ones. Added `pantsbuild` to three repositories working with approximately 20 engineers and contributed in-house features back upstream to the open-source project.
- Founding member of a cross-disciplinary team focused on cultivating a positive and inclusive work environment through initiatives promoting empathy, team building, and open communication.
- Reviewed hundreds of code changes from dozens of team members. Emphasized driving customer value, fostering team growth, and shared skill development.
