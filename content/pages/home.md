Hi! I'm Bryan Weber.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
I love to teach and write software. I am currently using machine learning to solve difficult problems in the defense space. I also work on open source software projects, mostly on <i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;[GitHub](https://github.com/bryanwweber). I share some of the things I've learned on my [blog](/writing.html).

In a past life, I was an academic so I'm obligated to maintain a list of my [publications]({filename}/pages/cv.md#publications). I also wrote an [online book about orbital mechanics](https://orbital-mechanics.space).

Please feel free to email any questions or inquiries to <bryan@bryanwweber.com>.
