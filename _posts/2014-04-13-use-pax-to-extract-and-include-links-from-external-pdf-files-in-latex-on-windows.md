title: Use pax to Extract and Include Links from External PDF files in LaTeX on Windows

I want to include the documentation for one of my programming projects
in my thesis. The documentation is generated by Sphinx, which can generate
LaTeX output. I compiled that output to PDF, which is relatively easy to
include in a separate LaTeX file with the [`pdfpages`][1] package.
Unfortunately, including a separate PDF file in this manner breaks
all the internal and external clickable links in the included PDF. The
solution is an experimental Java program called [`pax`][2]. Pax reads
the PDF file before it is included and generates a `.pax` file. `pdfTeX`
reads the `.pax` file when it includes the PDF and re-generates all of
the links.<!--more-->

Unfortunately, installing Pax is kind of a bear. The first thing to
do is download Java and Perl. [Java](http://java.com) is easy to download and install
on Windows; I used [Strawberry Perl][3] as my Perl interpreter.
Strawberry Perl gets installed in a directory in the root of the
`C:\` drive to avoid any permissions issues with the Program Files
directory. Next is to download PDFBox, which is a Java library for
operating on PDF files. Only version 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 will work,
which are available from [SourceForge][4]. Extract the zip file
into a directory with write permissions, like `C:\PDFBox`.

Pax itself can now be installed from the MikTeX package installer.
If you use the admin version, the scripts you need will be installed in
`...\MikTeX 2.9\scripts\pax`. Otherwise, note where MikTeX installed
the scripts for Pax. Then, we need to create a local texmf directory.
I followed the instructions [here][5] and created the directories
`C:\localtexmf\latex`, `C:\localtexmf\tex`, and `C:\localtexmf\bin`.
Then, in the Settings window for MikTeX, in the Roots tab, add this
the root directory (i.e. `C:\localtexmf`) and on the General tab,
click Update FNDB.

Now create a file in the `bin` directory called `pax.bat` and put
into it

{% highlight bat %}
@echo off
SETLOCAL

set CLASSPATH=C:\PDFBox\lib\PDFBox-0.7.3.jar;%CLASSPATH%

perl "C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\scripts\pax\pdfannotextractor.pl" %*
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, make sure the `C:\StrawberryPerl`, `C:\localtexmf\bin` and Java
directories are on your path. Then you can run

    pax FileWithLinksToBeIncluded.pdf

This will generate the `.pax` file. Credit for this solution goes to
the wonderful [TeX.SX][6]. Then, in the main TeX document, write

{% highlight latex %}
...
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{pax}
...
\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages={-}]{FileWithLinksToBeIncluded}
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

and compile with pdf(La)TeX. Note that Pax only works with pdf(La)TeX. It
cannot work with XeTeX (or XeLaTeX) according to [this post][7]. However,
LuaLaTeX supports nearly all of the `fontspec` options that XeTeX does,
and LuaLaTeX can be hacked to work with Pax. If you would like to use
LuaLaTeX, add the following to your preamble instead of `\usepackage{pax}`
[credit][8]:

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage{pdftexcmds}
\makeatletter
\let\pdfescapename=\pdf@escapename
\let\pdfstrcmp=\pdf@strcmp
\makeatother
\usepackage{pax}
{% endhighlight %}
