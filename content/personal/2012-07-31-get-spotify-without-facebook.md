Spotify, the ~~(supposedly, I just got an account)~~ **(Update: It is excellent,
and I highly recommend paying for premium)** excellent music streaming service,
offers free streaming stations to your mobile device and computer, similar to
Pandora. Since they just updated their Android app, I decided I wanted an
account, but found that the only way to get one was to connect to Facebook.
Since I didn't want to do that, a bit of googling found this
[link](http://www.spotidj.com/blog/how-to-get-spotify-without-facebook/), which
details how to sign up for a German account without connecting to Facebook, then
changing your country once you have an account. These instructions worked great,
except I had to go to the "Subscriptions" tab of my account to actually change
my country, by giving them a credit card or PayPal. Since I intend to get the
premium service if I like it, I didn't mind this, but you can delete the payment
information if you so wish after you change your country.
