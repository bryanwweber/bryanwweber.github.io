I've written a few more articles on _Real Python_ since my last post:

- **[Scientific Python: Using SciPy for Optimization][scipy]**: In this article, I cover a few of the optimization modules in [SciPy](https://scipy.org), including clustering and linear optimization.
- **[Using Python datetime to Work With Dates and Times][datetime]**: This article covers the nuts and bolts of the built-in [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) library as well as the drop-in replacement [`dateutil`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/).
- **[Pandas Project: Make a Gradebook With Python & Pandas][pandas]**: This was the first project-style article on _Real Python_. I used a script I already had working to compute my grades in my classes as the basis for this article. There's also a [video course](https://realpython.com/courses/gradebook-using-pandas-python/) for this article!
- **[Python enumerate(): Simplify Looping With Counters][enumerate]**: All about the built-in [`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) function. A deep dive on a topic that you didn't know needed a deep dive until you read it!

I've also helped edit a bunch more tutorials on the site:

- [Using the Python defaultdict Type for Handling Missing Keys](https://realpython.com/python-defaultdict/)
- [The Python math Module: Everything You Need to Know](https://realpython.com/python-math-module/)
- [Combining Data in Pandas With merge(), .join(), and concat()](https://realpython.com/pandas-merge-join-and-concat/)
- [Python eval(): Evaluate Expressions Dynamically](https://realpython.com/python-eval-function/)
- [Namespaces and Scope in Python](https://realpython.com/python-namespaces-scope/)
- [The Python return Statement: Usage and Best Practices](https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/)
- [Python's map(): Processing Iterables Without a Loop](https://realpython.com/python-map-function/)

Last, but by no means least, a couple other cool features.

1. My `__main__` article was turned into a video course over here: <https://realpython.com/courses/python-main-function/>
2. I contributed one of my favorite packages to a feature article: [Python Packages: Five Real Python Favorites](https://realpython.com/python-packages/)

Over all these tutorials, I'm getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 weekly views! That just feels incredible, to help so many folks on their journey with Python. Keep coding everyone!
