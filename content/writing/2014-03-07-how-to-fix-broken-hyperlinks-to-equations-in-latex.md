While writing my dissertation in LaTeX, I was having a problem that some
sub-equations were not linking to the correct place. The solution is to load the
`mathtools` package before the `hyperref` package. [This question][1] on TeX.SX
showed the way, even though I'm not using the `\numberwithin{equation}{section}`
line.
