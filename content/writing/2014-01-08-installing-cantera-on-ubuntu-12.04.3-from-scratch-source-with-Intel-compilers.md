## UPDATE 01-01-2016 {: #Update}

I have posted new instructions for how to build the developer's version of
Cantera in a new post: [Installing Cantera on Ubuntu with Intel Compilers
UPDATED!]({filename}2016-01-01-how-to-install-cantera-on-ubuntu-updated.md)

## Introduction {: #Introduction}

My lab typically uses the CHEMKIN-Pro software from [Reaction
Design](http://reactiondesign.com) to perform simulations of our experiments.
Unfortunately, CHEMKIN-Pro is closed source and does not include a number of
features I have found useful for my research. Thus, my labmate and I have
recently endeavored to install a separate software package on our Ubuntu 12.04.3
server to perform these simulations.

This software is called
[Cantera](http://cantera.github.io/docs/sphinx/html/index.html), and is an
open-source, C++-based "suite of object-oriented software tools" designed to
perform chemical and thermodynamic simulations. Although it was once rather
difficult to install, recent upgrades have improved the install and usage
procedure drastically. Cantera can be used from one of several interfaces - C++,
Fortran, MATLAB, or Python. Essentially, each of the interfaces allows the user
to easily access the functions and methods at the heart of Cantera and conduct
their work without worrying about the details of, say, how to calculate a
reaction rate. On our server, we decided to install the C++, Fortran, and Python
interfaces. Unfortunately, the MATLAB interface is broken when using the Intel
compilers, due to problems with MATLAB itself. In fact, any MEX application
compiled with the Intel compilers will not work, so this is not Cantera's fault!

Despite the newly acquired ease of installation, we could not leave well enough
alone and decided to complicate things by using C, C++, and Fortran compilers
distributed by Intel, since our server has 24 Intel Xeon CPUs. Intel provides a
number of options with their compilers that enable Intel-compiled applications
to run significantly faster on Intel processors than applications compiled using
other compilers (e.g. Gnu).

Note that in all the following steps, except where explicitly noted, I will
assume that you have `sudo` or root access. This is because some of the
dependencies will be installed in the `/usr/local/` folder, which requires root
permissions to write to. If you do not have root access, you will have to modify
many of the below instructions, and I have tried to note in a few places where
the commands must be changed.

## Install Intel Compilers {: #InstallIntelCompilers}

First we have to install some dependences for the Intel compilers. See
[here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-compilers-for-linux-with-ubuntu)
for more instructions.

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib rpm openjdk-6-jre-headless
```

The next step is to install the Intel compilers themselves. My lab has a license
to the Intel Fortran and C/C++ compiler suites, which also include Intel's Math
Kernel Library (MKL). The MKL contains the LAPACK and BLAS implementations
required by the solvers in Cantera (and other software as well). If you are
using the compilers for "non- commercial software development", you can also
download a copy of the Fortran and C/C++ compiler suites from
[here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/non-commercial-software-development).
Included in the scripts are fairly standard installers - mostly you can go
through them by the "Next->Next->Next" method. If you get a warning that 32-bit
dependencies are not installed, go back to the step that lists all of the
packages to be installed and choose "Customize Installation" at the
bottom-center of the window. Then, deselect "32-bit support" since we will not
be compiling any 32-bit applications.

Once the Intel compilers are installed, it is very important to add them to your
PATH environment variable. Intel helpfully provides a script to set all of the
relevant variables at once. You can source this script from your login script to
allow easy access to the compilers. On our server, this meant adding `source
/opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64` to the `~/.profile` file. On a desktop
install, the better place to add this is in the `~/.bashrc` file

## Install Dependencies {: #InstallDependencies}

Next, install (some) of the dependencies for Cantera and its dependencies. The
server on which we intended to install Cantera has a "well-loved" Ubuntu
install, as in, many packages were already installed. We were using the 4.4
versions of the GNU compilers but the default version of GCC for Ubuntu 12.04 is
4.6. Despite that we will be using the Intel compilers for most of the stuff
here, in some cases the Intel compilers are little more than a wrapper around
the GNU compilers. To easily switch the entire system between compiler versions,
use the built-in program
[`update-alternatives`](http://askubuntu.com/questions/233190/what-exactly-does-update-alternatives-do).

The following commands were tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04.3
with GCC 4.6, with only package updates and the Intel compilers installed (as
shown above), so it should get anyone up and running.

A list of Cantera's dependencies can be found at the [documentation
site](http://cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/compiling/dependencies.html). The
following dependencies from `apt-get` are required. This does not cover all of
the dependencies in the documentation, but we will be installing some others
separately.

```bash
sudo apt-get install scons subversion python python-dev python3 python3-dev \
libsuitesparse-dev libbz2-dev libbz2-1.0 wget git git-svn swig
```

Not all of these dependencies are dependencies of Cantera itself; some of them
are dependencies of the dependencies.

With the `apt-get` installs out of the way, its time to move on to the Python
dependencies. First up is `pip`, which makes installing the other dependencies
much easier. One note - if you do not have admin access (i.e. `sudo` rights) on
the particular machine you're using, be sure to specify the `--user` option to
all of the following `easy_install` commands (and you'll have to have gotten a
sysadmin to do the previous steps). The `--user` option will install the
packages in the directory `/home/username/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`,
which is editable by the user and thus doesn't require super-user rights.

```bash
wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py \
-O - | sudo python3.2
sudo easy_install-3.2 pip
wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py \
-O - | sudo python2.7
sudo easy_install pip
```

It is important to install for Python 3 first, because otherwise the executables
of `easy_install` and `pip` for Python 3 will overwrite those for Python 2, and
forevermore you'll get unexpected behavior. Then, with `pip` installed, we can
do

```bash
sudo pip install cython 3to2 nose ipython
sudo pip3.2 install cython 3to2-py3k nose ipython
#The following is only required if you want to build the Cantera documentation
sudo pip install Sphinx pygments pyparsing sphinxcontrib-doxylink
```

## Install NumPy/SciPy {: #InstallNumpyScipy}

A quick perusal of the list of dependencies shows that NumPy and SciPy are also
required to use the Python interface. If you would like to compile these with
the Intel compilers, see
[here]({filename}2014-01-11-installing-numpy-scipy-on-ubuntu-12.04.3-from-scratch-source-with-intel-compilers.md).
If using GCC is OK with you, then `pip` should be good enough.

```bash
sudo pip install numpy scipy
sudo pip3.2 install numpy scipy
```

## Install Boost {: #InstallBoost}

Now we come to the fun stuff. Its time to install some dependencies - from
source! First up is Boost. Ubuntu has a version of Boost in the repositories,
but I found errors during the build and/or test process of Cantera when I used
the pre-compiled Boost libraries. This was apparently due to the fact that they
had been compiled with a different compiler. As of this writing, the newest
version of Boost is 1.55.0, but the absolute newest versions can be found at the
SourceForge download site: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/>

When you have downloaded the appropriate `.tar.gz` file, unzip it with the command

``` bash
tar -xzf boost_X_YY_Z.tar.gz
```

Then change to the appropriate directory (most likely `boost_X_YY_Z`), and run
the following commands

```bash
sudo -s
source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=intel-linux
./b2 -a -q --link=shared --variant=release --address-model=64 \
    --compileflags="-xhost -fp-model precise -O3" -j2 \
    --threading=multi install
exit
```

Let's look at these commands.

1. Switch to the root terminal (if you don't have `sudo` permissions, see below)
2. Since the regular environment isn't passed to the root user, we have to setup
   the Intel compilers again.
3. Run the setup script `bootstrap.sh` to tell Boost which compiler we will use.
4. Run the install program that `bootstrap.sh` has created. The options (as far
   as I know them) are:
   - `-a`: Rebuild all targets, even if they're up-to-date
   - `-q`: Quit the build on the first error
   - `--link=shared`: Build shared libraries.
   - `--variant=release`: Build the release version. No idea if its required.
   - `--address-model=64`: Build 64 bit binaries. No idea if its required.
   - `--compileflags="..."`: Flags sent to the C and C++ compilers. These
     options are
     - `-xhost`: Add additional Intel specific optimizations
     - `-fp-model precise`: Use the `precise` floating point model
     - `-O3`: The optimization level to be used by the compiler
   - `-j2`: Specify the number of compile processes to run in parallel.
   - `install`: Install the libraries and headers
5. Exit root

If you don't have `sudo` privileges, you can use the option
`--prefix=/path/to/install`. Make sure that you have permissions to write to
`/path/to/install`. The `--prefix` option should be specified to `b2` I think -
not sure about that, proceed at your own risk. If resources are tight, you can
add `--with-python --with-regex --with-system --with-thread` to install only the
minimal set of libraries that Cantera requires. Note also that these directions
are somewhat different than the ones provided at [the official
documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html)
so proceed at your own risk.

## Install Sundials {: #InstallSundials}

The next step is to install Sundials. Sundials is a suite of solvers and are
used in Cantera to enable sensitivity analysis. Technically, its optional, but
we're going for all the bells and whistles, so let's go for it. Download
Sundials (as of this writing, the most recent version is 2.5.0) from here:
<http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/download/download.html>. Similar to
the Boost section, we untar the tarball

```bash
tar -xzf sundials-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
```

Then change to the appropriate directory and run the following commands

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
../configure CXX=icpc CC=icc F77=ifort --with-blas="mkl_rt" \
    --with-lapack="mkl_rt" \
    --with-libs="-L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_core \
    -lmkl_intel_thread -lpthread -liomp5 -lm" \
    --with-cflags="-xhost -O3 -m64 -I$MKLROOT/include -fPIC -fp-model precise" \
    --with-cppflags="-xhost -O3 -m64 -I$MKLROOT/include -fPIC -fp-model precise" \
    --with-fflags="-xhost -O3 -m64 -I$MKLROOT/include -fPIC -fp-model precise" \
    --enable-shared
make
sudo -s
source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
make install
exit
```

Let's take a look at these commands now too.

1. Create a build directory and change into it
2. Give Sundials all the options we're going to use
   - `../configure`: The configure script in the directory one up that creates a
     Makefile
   - `CXX=icpc`: Which C++ compiler to use (`icpc` is the name of the Intel C++
     compiler)
   - `CC=icc`: Which C compiler to use (`icc` is the name of the Intel C
     compiler)
   - `F77=ifort`: Which Fortran compiler to use (`ifort` is the name of the
     Intel Fortran compiler)
   - `--with-blas="mkl_rt"`: This tells Sundials to use BLAS from the Intel MKL
   - `--with-lapack="mkl_rt"`: This tells Sundials to use LAPACK from the Intel
     MKL
   - `--with-libs="..."`: This line tells Sundials where it can find all of the
     fancy Intel MKL stuff. ~~The `mkl_intel_thread` and `iomp5` entries are
     particularly important, as these enable multi-threaded solving for the
     Cantera 1-D solvers.~~ Update: Further testing has shown that including
     these libraries in SUNDIALS is not important for the 1-D solver in Cantera.
     I think these libraries are only required if the Intel MKL will be used in
     a program that uses OpenMP threading.
   - `--with-cflags="..."`, `--with-cppflags="..."`, and `--with-fflags="..."`:
     These are compiler flags for Sundials.
     - `-xhost`: Intel specific optimizations for Intel processors
     - `-O3`: Optimization level
     - `-m64`: Build for 64 bits
     - `-I$MKLROOT/include`: `MKLROOT` is an environment variable defined by the
       Intel `compilervars.sh` script. This flag tells the compiler where it can
       find the include files the library needs.
     - `-fPIC`: Generate position independent code, ~~meaning the compiled file
       does not depend on being in a particular location in the filesystem.~~
       meaning the library does not depend on being in a particular location in
       memory when it is compiled into a separate program.
     - `-fp-model precise`: Use the `precise` floating point model
   - `--enable-shared`: Build the shared libraries in addition to the static
     libraries.
3. Run `make` to compile and link all the files
4. Switch to root to install the libraries
5. Source the Intel variables as root
6. Install everything with `make install`
7. Exit root

## Install Cantera {#InstallCantera}

Now we have finally finished installing the dependencies, and we can actually
install Cantera itself. You can either download the tarball of the most recent
stable source from here:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/cantera/files/cantera/> and unzip it by

```bash
tar -xzf cantera-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
```

Alternatively, you can download the source code by Subversion or
[`git-svn`](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html)

```bash
svn checkout http://cantera.googlecode.com/svn/cantera/branches/2.1/ cantera
#                                                                   ^The space here is
#                                                                    important
```

or

```bash
git svn clone --stdlayout http://cantera.googlecode.com/svn/cantera/ cantera
#                                                                   ^The space here is
#                                                                    important
cd cantera
git checkout 2.1
```

Either of these options will give you the most recent stable build of Cantera.
If you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can download the developer version
of Cantera by either

```bash
svn checkout http://cantera.googlecode.com/svn/cantera/trunk cantera
#                                                           ^The space here is
#                                                            important
```

or

```bash
git svn clone --stdlayout http://cantera.googlecode.com/svn/cantera/ cantera
#                                                                   ^The space here is
#                                                                    important
```

and don't give the `git checkout 2.1` line. After that, change into the
directory where Cantera was downloaded or unzipped.

Now we need to configure the installation of Cantera. This configuration file
will install the Cantera files in a different directory per user. The reason for
this is that we wanted to allow each user of the server to have their own
independent install of Cantera, rather than a global single version. Create a
file called `cantera.conf` and copy the following into it

```python
CXX = 'icpc'
CC = 'icc'
prefix = '/home/_username_/.local'
python_package = 'new'
python_prefix = 'USER'
python3_prefix = 'USER'
python_compiler = 'icpc'
f90_interface = 'y'
F90 = 'ifort'
F90FLAGS = '-O3 -xhost'
use_sundials = 'y'
sundials_include = '/usr/local/include'
sundials_libdir = '/usr/local/lib'
blas_lapack_libs = 'mkl_rt'
blas_lapack_dir = '/opt/intel/composerxe/mkl/lib/intel64/'
env_vars = 'all'
cc_flags = '-Wall -Wno-deprecated -xhost -fp-model precise'
debug_linker_flags = '-lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_intel_thread -lpthread -liomp5'
build_thread_safe = True
boost_inc_dir = '/usr/local/include'
boost_lib_dir = '/usr/local/lib'
boost_thread_lib = 'boost_system'
F77 = 'ifort'
F77FLAGS = '-O3 -xhost'
rpfont = 'helvetica'
```

`_username_` should be the username where Cantera should be installed. To see an
explanation of these options, type `scons install help`. Note that you may have
to change the directory of the Intel MKL. Briefly, they are:

- `CXX`, `CC`, `F90`, and `F77`: The compilers to use for the C++, C, and
  Fortran files respectively
- `prefix`: The directory in which Cantera should be installed. If using the
   Python interface, the `~/.local` directory is on Python's path by default, so
   it is a good choice if a per-user install is desired
- `python_prefix`,`python3_prefix`: The directories where the Python module
  should be installed. Specifying `'USER'` tells the installer to put the module
  in the default user directory, which is `~/.local` by default. This overrides
  any value of the prefix, so if you want the Python module installed in the
  prefix directory, delete these lines
- `python_compiler`: The compiler to use when compiling the Python module.
  Should be the same as `CXX`.
- `f90_interface`: Compile the Fortran 90 interface
- `F90FLAGS` and `F77FLAGS`: Flags to send to the Fortran compiler when
  compiling the Fortran 90 and Fortran 77 interfaces, respectively
- `use_sundials`: Specify whether or not to use SUNDIALS
- `sundials_include`,`sundials_libdir`: The directories where Cantera can find
  the header files and the Sundials libraries, respectively. Should be set to
  the directory where Sundials was installed
- `blas_lapack_libs`, `blas_lapack_dir`: The libraries and directory for BLAS
  and LAPACK. To use the Intel MKL, `mkl_rt` should be specified for the `libs`,
  and the full absolute path to the directory where the libraries are stored
  needs to be given. Note that in this configuration, shell variables such as
  `$MKLHOME` cannot be used because they won't be expanded properly (at least, I
  got an error when I tried that)
- `env_vars`: The environment variables that should be passed in from the shell.
  This should be set to `all` so that the installer can find the Intel compilers
- `cc_flags`: The C and C++ compiler flags
- `debug_linker_flags`: All the libraries Cantera should link to
- `build_thread_safe`: Allow Cantera to be used in multi-threaded applications
- `boost_inc_dir`, `boost_lib_dir`: Similar to Sundials, the include and
  libraries directories where Boost was installed
- `boost_thread_lib`: Libraries to include when building the Boost threaded
  components
- `rpfont`: The font to use when printing reaction paths.

After `cantera.conf` is set, its time to build and install Cantera. The
following commands will build, test, and install Cantera:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
scons build -j2
scons test
scons install
```

As before, the `-jn` option specifies the number of build tasks to perform in
parallel. Set `n` less than or equal to the number of processors you wish to use
to perform the build. Higher `n` makes the build go much faster as long as you
don't exceed the number of processors on your computer. After that, change out
of the Cantera directory, and in Python 2 & 3 shells, type

```python
>>> import cantera
```

If no errors pop out, you've done it! Congratulations! Now just make some small
additions to your `~/.bashrc` file (at the bottom of the file) so that Cantera
is ready to go on each login:

```bash
source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
export PATH=/home/username/.local/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/_username_/.local/lib:/usr/local/lib:usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export MANPATH=/home/username/.local/man:$MANPATH
```
