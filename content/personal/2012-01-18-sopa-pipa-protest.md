Title: Please Oppose SOPA and PIPA!
category: personal
date: 2012-01-18

Today there are many huge websites, including Google and Wikipedia who are blacking out their homepages to oppose two acts before Congress called SOPA and PIPA. Although I will typically have no desire to discuss politics on this forum, I want to make an exception to show my opposition to these bills as well. More formally known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (in the House) and the PROTECT IP Act (in the Senate), the details of them are too gory to go into in what I intend here to be a short post. If you want all the details, go [here to Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html) or [here to The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/22/2648219/stop-online-piracy-act-sopa-what-is-it).

Let me start with a disclaimer: Fighting piracy is a noble and useful goal. However, these bills are set up to do much more social harm than good. From my perspective, the worst part of these bills is that they give private parties the right to take down websites "dedicated to infringing content" - without an adversarial hearing. That is, websites who have been determined to be "dedicated to infringing content" can have their property removed from them without having a chance to defend themselves. This seems to be against the right of "innocent until proven guilty" that was pounded into my head in all those civics classes in grade school. In addition, the definition of "dedicated to infringing content" is not specific enough to rule out sites such as, for example, Google. Could you imagine using the internet without search engines? That's what I thought.

Anyway, enough of my rambling, here is a list of links to more information:

By far the most awesome is this animated GIF from The Oatmeal:
