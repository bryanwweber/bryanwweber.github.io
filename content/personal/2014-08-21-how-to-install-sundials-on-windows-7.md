[SUNDIALS](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) is a SUite of
Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers. It is useful for many
problems, and is needed to perform sensitivity analysis in Cantera. It can be a
pain to install on Windows, so here is my procedure for installing on Windows 7
x64.
<!--more-->

First, download the [Windows SDK 7.1][1] and the [SP1 compiler update][2].
Installation should be a "Next->Next" affair, but if the install fails, [The
Mathworks recommends][3] the following steps:

1. Uninstall any Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable packages
2. Install the SDK again, but uncheck the options for the compiler and the
   Visual C++ Redistributable
3. Install the compiler update, which will install the compilers
4. Reinstall the Visual C++ Redistributable from [this
   link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632)

If you would like to have Visual Studio installed in addition to the SDK, the
instructions [here][4] give the proper order to install everything.

Next, download and install CMake from
<http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html> To properly install SUNDIALS,
CMake 2.8.12.2 is required. Then, download SUNDIALS from
<http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html> You will need 7zip to
extract the tarball on Windows, which can be found here: <http://www.7-zip.org/>

Extract the tarball to the root of the `C:\` drive, so you have a folder
`C:\sundials-2.5.0`. Create new folders called `C:\sundials-2.5.0-build` and
`C:\sundials-2.5.0-install`. In the `C:\sundials-2.5.0` folder is a file called
`CMakeLists.txt`. Open that file, and change `SET(PACKAGE_STRING "SUNDIALS
2.4.0")` to `SET(PACKAGE_STRING "SUNDIALS 2.5.0")`. Do the same for the line
`SET(PACKAGE_VERSION "2.4.0")` to `SET(PACKAGE_VERSION "2.5.0")`. Open the
Windows SDK 7.1 command line interface and build and install SUNDIALS:

```batch
cd C:\sundials-2.5.0-build
cmake ..\sundials-2.5.0 -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\sundials-2.5.0-install
nmake install
```

That should be it - SUNDIALS is now installed in the `install` directory. Happy
solving!
