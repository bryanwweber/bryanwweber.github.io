Setting up a development environment for Cantera on Windows 7 can be a little
trickier than on
[Linux]({filename}2014-01-08-installing-cantera-on-ubuntu-12.04.3-from-scratch-source-with-Intel-compilers.md).
This post contains instructions for how I set up my development environment on
Windows 7.
<!--more-->

The first step is to download the [SDK 7.1 compiler][1] and its [SP1 update][2].
Installation should be a "Next->Next" affair, but if the install fails, [The
Mathworks recommends][3] the following steps:

1. Uninstall any Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable packages
2. Install the SDK again, but uncheck the options for the compiler and the
   Visual C++ Redistributable
3. Install the compiler update, which will install the compilers
4. Reinstall the Visual C++ Redistributable from [this
   link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632)

If you would like to have Visual Studio installed in addition to the SDK, the
instructions [here][6] give the proper order to install everything.

If you only have the SDK and its update installed, Microsoft has
not-so-helpfully removed a file that is necessary to build Cantera, called
`ammintrin.h`. There is a post [at The Mathworks][4] forum with a link to the
file, and I'll also post it [here][5] for reference. Add this file to the
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include` directory, and
it should be all set. If you have Visual Studio installed, this will not be a
problem.

Next, install [SUNDIALS](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html)
(I've helpfully posted some instructions
[here]({filename}2014-08-21-how-to-install-sundials-on-windows-7.md)). Then,
download and unzip the Boost libraries: <http://www.boost.org/> I recommend
unzipping into the root of the `C:\` drive, so there will be a folder called
`boost_1_56_0` (for the most recent version as of this writing) with all the
required files inside. Note that if you're not careful, you'll get a folder
`C:\boost_1_56_0\boost_1_56_0`, which is not what we want, it should be just
`C:\boost_1_56_0\<files go here>`.

Now we need other components of the development environment, particularly Python
and all its packages. The most recent versions of Python are 2.7.8 and 3.4.1,
which can be downloaded respectively [here][py278] and [here][py341]. Make sure
to get the proper version for your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit).
Installation into the default directories is preferable, and make sure to have
the python.exe added to your path.

If you forget to add python.exe to your path in the installer, open the System
control panel (++lwin+pause++), choose "Advanced System Settings" in the left
panel, then choose the "Advanced" tab, and at the bottom click "Environment
Variables". In the "System variables" box, find "Path" and add
`C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;` to the front
of the text box.

While we're here, we need to add one environment variable. Click "New", and in
the first text box add `VS90COMNTOOLS` and in the second box add
`%VS100COMNTOOLS%`. This sets the variable called `VS90COMNTOOLS` to be equal to
the value of the variable called `VS100COMNTOOLS`. `VS100COMNTOOLS` is set by
the SDK when it is installed, but Python 2 depends on `VS90COMNTOOLS` being
installed. This allows us to install certain packages with `pip` in Python 2.
Note that not all packages will work with this trick (in particular,
`matplotlib` can't be installed with `pip` this way).

Python 3.4 comes with `pip` installed, but 2.7 does not, plus we need some other
packages anyways. Head to [Christoph Gohlke's
page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and download the following
packages. Make sure to get the correct bitness for your Python versions.

2.7:

- [`setuptools`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools)
- [`pip`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip)
- [`numpy`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
- [`cython`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython)
- [`scons`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scons)

3.4:

- [`numpy`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
- [`cython`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython)

Install these after you install Python. Now, open the "Windows SDK 7.1 Command
Prompt" (searching for 7.1 in the Start Menu search box usually brings it up)
and install some additional packages for Python with the following command:

```batch
pip2 install sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain sphinxcontrib-doxylink 3to2
```

This will fetch all the Python packages required to build the documentation and
the package (3to2) to convert the examples from Python 3 syntax to Python 2
syntax.

You should also install Doxygen at this point, so that the C++ documentation can
be built. The Windows installer for the most recent version of Doxygen (at the
time of this writing, 1.8.8) is available on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/files/rel-1.8.8/doxygen-1.8.8-setup.exe).
Finally, install the [WiX Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/) so that MSI
installers for Cantera can be built.

That should (finally) be all the software needed to get up and running in
developing Cantera. The last thing to do is actually get the Cantera source
code. There are several ways to get the code; my preferred way is to use GitHub.
Ray Speth has a clone of the main Cantera repository on GitHub:
<https://github.com/Cantera/cantera>. What you should do is create a fork of
this project into your own personal GitHub account. This way, you can add
branches, do all your work, push them to your forked repository, and create a
pull request so that Ray can see the code and help you improve it. Then, either
use the [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com) client, or clone the
repository yourself.

Once in the main Cantera directory, we need to tell SCons how to build Cantera.
Create a file called `cantera.conf` and put as its contents:

    msvc_version = '10.0'
    python_cmd = 'C:/Python27/python.exe'
    python3_cmd = 'C:/Python34/python.exe'
    matlab_path = 'C:/Program Files/MATLAB/R2014a'
    sundials_include = 'C:/sundials-2.5.0-install/include'
    sundials_libdir = 'C:/sundials-2.5.0-install/lib'
    env_vars = 'all'
    boost_inc_dir = 'C:/boost_1_56_0/'

Now, `scons build` and `scons msi` should work. If you get errors, read on.

<s>The first warning you might see is that 3to2 is not installed properly, even
though we installed it earlier. This is because the SConstruct file calls <code>3to2</code>
as an executable, which doesn't work on Windows. The fix for this is to edit
two lines, one in the root <code>SConstruct</code> file, one in the <code>interfaces/cython/SConscript</code>
file. First, in <code>SConstruct</code> change:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCommandOutput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'3to2'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'-l'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

to

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getCommandOutput</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'python_cmd'</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="s1">'C:/Python27/Scripts/3to2'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'-l'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

Then, in <code>interfaces/cython/SConscript</code>, change:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">'3to2'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'--no-diff'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-n'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-w'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'-x'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'str'</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>

to

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'python_cmd'</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="s1">'C:/Python27/Scripts/3to2'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'--no-diff'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-n'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-w'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'-x'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'str'</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>

Note that these are basically hacks until the problem can be fixed in the source.</s>

As of [eeab08](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/commit/eeab08d683fbbf40924b11fdc4d84e74a311aa1b), this problem has been fixed.

Second, you may get actual errors when trying to build the MATLAB interface (if
you aren't building this interface, you might not see this error). In case you
get an error in the MATLAB interface about redefining `_char16t`, open
`src/matlab/ctmatutils.h` and comment out lines 12-14. These lines were
introduced to fix some problems in MATLAB R2010a, and aren't required for at
least R2013a and R2014a.
