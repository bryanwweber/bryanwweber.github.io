@mastersthesis{Weber2010,
abstract = {Autoignition delay experiments were performed for n-butanol in a heated rapid compression machine. Experiments were performed at pressures of 15 and 30 bar, in the temperature range 650-900 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Additionally, the initial fuel mole fraction and initial oxygen mole fraction were varied independently to determine the influence of each on ignition delay. Over the conditions studied, it was found that the reactivity of the mixture increased as equivalence ratio, initial fuel mole fraction or initial oxygen mole fraction increased. A non-linear correlation to the experimental data was performed and showed nearly second order dependence on the initial oxygen mole fraction and nearly first order dependence on initial fuel mole fraction and compressed pressure. This was the first study of the ignition of n-butanol in this temperature and pressure range, and contributes to a better understanding of the chemistry of this fuel under the conditions relevant to practical devices. Experimentally measured ignition delays were compared against the ignition delay computed from several reaction mechanisms in the literature. The agreement between experiments and simulations was found to be unsatisfactory. Sensitivity analysis was performed and indicated that the uncertainties of the rate constants of parent fuel decomposition reactions play a major role in causing the poor agreement. Further path analysis of the fuel decomposition reactions supported this conclusion and highlighted the particular importance of certain pathways. Based on these results, it was concluded that further investigation of the fuel decomposition, including speciation measurements, will be required.},

@phdthesis{Weber2014a,
abstract = {Using the Rapid Compression Machine at the University of Connecticut, studies of the autoignition behavior of alternative fuels are conducted in the temperature range 650 K to 900 K and the pressure range 15 bar to 50 bar with a focus on developing a fundamental understanding of the chemistry controlling the autoignition of alternative fuels atengine relevant—high-pressure and low-to-intermediate temperature—conditions. Thealternativefuelsstudiedhereincludefivebio-alcoholfuels—n-butanol, s-butanol, t-butanol,i-butanol, and i-pentanol—that are studied to investigate the effect of the alcohol groupand molecular structures on autoignition behavior. In addition, methylcyclohexane—an important component of fuels derived from alternative petroleum sources and a component in surrogate transportation fuel formulations—is studied. The ignition delay of the alcohols shows no evidence of phenomena such as two-stage ignition and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) of the ignition delay. However, the relative reactivity shows a complicated dependence on the molecular structure and the pressure and temperature conditions. Moreover, i-pentanol and t-butanol show similar heat release behavior prior to the main ignition event. These results are explained through detailed chemical kinetic analysis in terms of the unique chemistry possible in each alcohol because of their unique structures. The ignition behavior of methylcyclohexane is similar to alkanes and other cycloalkanes, in that methylcyclohexane shows strong two-stage ignition and NTC behavior. Analysis of a detailed kinetic model shows that the prominent reaction pathways causing this behavior are also similar between methylcyclohexane and similar molecules, indicating that thereaction types controlling the autoignition behavior of hydrocarbons are common among many fuel structures. In addition, gas samples extracted from the reaction chamber during the induction period are used to identify and quantify important intermediate species during the autoignition of methylcyclohexane. The experimental data developed in this work provide a comprehensive set of archival ignition data that can be used to benchmark and validate chemical kinetic models for the combustion of alternative fuels. These data also indicate the remaining gaps in the understanding of the high-pressure ignition chemistry of alternative fuels and provide preliminary directions for future research to close the gaps.},
